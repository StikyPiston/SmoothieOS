# SmoothieOS

A little OS I made in ComputerCraft, using a tutorial by Homelab on YouTube!
!! As of now, the chat client and file transfer as well as the installmedia builder don't work !!

# INSTALL

The installer comes in the form of 2 Disks.
!! THE OS MAY NOT FIT ON A COMPUTER WITH THE DEFAULT STORAGE. YOU MAY NEED TO INCREASE STORAGE IN CONFIG !!

# CONFIG

The Config file can be edited using "edit /smoothieos/config.lua" or just "conf"
You may make programs that add extra lines to the config.

# INSTALLING APPS

You can install apps with the "pineget" command followed by an App ID from https://pinestore.cc
These do not show up in the programs list, however.
